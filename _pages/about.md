<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, specializing in Robotics. My academic focus centers on control systems and robot learning.

Previously, I studied Aerospace Engineering at the University of Nottingham, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Prof. Erwin(Xin) Dong. Under his guidance, I began exploring robotics and gained foundational knowledge in this field.

# üî• News
- *2024.08*: &nbsp;üéâ I‚Äôm heading to the University of Michigan to pursue my master's degree, and I‚Äôm eager to explore more about robotics. Hoping to expand my knowledge and skills in this fascinating area!

**ArmLab [[code](https://github.com/UncleXuu/ArmLab)] [[video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Pw4TuiCOPQg)]**

- Armlab is a course project for UMich ROB550-Robotic Systems Lab. In this project, an RGB-D camera was used to detect the size, color, position, and height of blocks. The project also involved implementing both forward and inverse kinematics for a 5DOF robotic arm, which was then used to perform a series of tasks. This project achieved first place in the final competition.

**Cycloidal Propeller [[video](https://youtube.com/shorts/_IwL4TRK-bA)]**

- This underwater robot can move in all directions, just like McNamara wheels. This project involves achieving directional and depth-controlled movement by utilizing data from the IMU and depth sensor, along with PID control.

**Drawing Robot [[code](https://github.com/UncleXuu/Drawing_Robot_Tic_Tac_Toe)] [[video](https://youtu.be/WPUbCplfAMw?si=HOGm8zRXLjzOUu34)]**

- The drawing robot is capable of executing Tic Tac Toe games between two players through a command-line interface. Players can select grid sizes and choose their unique patterns from a list. The robot autonomously determines the winner and visually highlights the victory by drawing a line through the matching sequence.

**Swirling Adhesion [[video1](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rjxmZVoMi4o)] [[video2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4uXqqEbQ6Xs)]**

- Designed and validated a non-contact swirling adhesion system for both air and underwater environments. Demonstrated that this device can generate strong suction on even rough surfaces while maintaining minimal tangential forces. This unique feature makes it highly suitable for robotic applications, enabling robots to adhere strongly to a wide range of surfaces.
